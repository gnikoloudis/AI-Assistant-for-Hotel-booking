Variation 1:
1. Dear Team at Maria's,
I am interested in booking a double room with breakfast for a stay starting on the 5th of February. My stay will be for 5 days and 4 nights, and my flight is expected to arrive late in the evening. Could you accommodate a late check-in for me? Additionally, I would like to request a high-floor smoking room if possible. Also, please note that my friend will be arriving separately, so we will have different check-in times. Please confirm the booking details for myself (Dave) and my friend (Kris) for visa purposes at the immigration checkpoint. Kindly provide a confirmation of the booking at your earliest convenience. Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the number provided below.
Thank you,
Dave
