Dear Maria Hotel,

I am reaching out to inquire about reserving a double room for 3 days and 2 nights, excluding breakfast, next month from October 22nd to October 25th. Is it possible to have a room with ample space for my children?

I plan to arrive at 11 am on the check-in day. Would you be able to assist me in making a reservation at a restaurant nearby the hotel for our lunch? After a 5-hour car journey, my family would appreciate a simple meal before returning to the hotel for some rest.

I look forward to receiving confirmation of the booking. Please let me know if any additional information is required from my end.
