Dear Marriot Hotel,

I would like to reserve a two bedroom with twin bed in each room for 2 days 1 night with breakfast on November 10. Could I have a room with balcony? 

I take first flight so I will arrive at the hotel around 10 a.m. if it possible, could I get early check in? Also, I need fast Wifi connection because I have a few things to work on evening. 

I have promotional code. Please can you give me the room rate tomorrow and do you accept credit card? Do the room is already breakfast included?


Please let me know if you need further information.


Kindly Regards,

George
