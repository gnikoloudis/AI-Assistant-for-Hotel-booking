Hello Maria Team,
I would like to make reservation for a double room with breakfast on the 5th of February and I will stay there 5 days and 4 nights. My flight arrival will be
a little late in the evening. So, could you arrange late check in? Can I also request high floor with smoking room if possible. Moreover, my friend will come from different place. Hence, we both will be different check in time.
Hence, could you please release booking confirmation mentioned below names : 
1) Dave and 2) Kris for visa purpose at immigration check point?
Could you please confirm about booking? If there is anything you would like to know, please contact below number.

Many Thanks,
Dave
