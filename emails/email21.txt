Subject: Inquiry Regarding Reservation for a Single Room with Pool View

Greetings Reservation staff,

I am looking to reserve an accessible single room for a two-night stay, inclusive of breakfast, on June 25th. If possible, I would appreciate having a peaceful room with a view of the pool.

I appreciate your assistance in accommodating my preferences.

Warm regards,
George
