Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. We are writing to inquire about availability for two rooms in your hotel on December 31st. Our trip to the hills has been planned for some time now and we are very much looking forward to our stay with you.


Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

John Doe
